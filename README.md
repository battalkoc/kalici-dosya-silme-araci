# Permanent File Deletion Tool & Kalıcı Dosya Silme Aracı

This project is a simple tool that allows users to permanently delete specified files. The program overwrites the specified file with random data, changes the content of the file, and then deletes it, effectively removing any traces of the file from the disk.

## Features

- Provides a user-friendly interface.
- Allows selection of the file to be deleted.
- Enables users to specify how many times random data will be written over the file.
- Informs the user about the result of the operation with information dialog boxes.
- Can be used as a Python script (`deleter.py`) or as a standalone executable Windows application (`deleter.exe`).

## How to Use

1. Download or clone the project files to your computer.
2. Run the `deleter.py` file to execute the tool in the Python environment.
3. Alternatively, run the `deleter.exe` file to execute it as a standalone application on Windows.
4. When the program starts, a file selection window will open. Choose the file you want to delete.
5. Specify how many times random data should be written over the file in the "Tekrar Sayısı of Iterations" field.
6. Click the "İşlemi Başlat" button to begin the process.
7. You will be informed about the result of the operation with information dialog boxes once it's completed.
